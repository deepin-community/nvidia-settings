nvidia-settings (525.85.05-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 525.85.05.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented some controls in the nvidia-settings
      control panel from working when running an X server as an
      unprivileged user.
  * New upstream release 525.78.01.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the nvidia-settings control panel to
      crash when using a newer control panel with an older driver.
  * New upstream release 525.53.
    - Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to prevent the creation
      of display layouts that exceed hardware size limitations when using
      the SLI Mosaic configuration page, and to display a warning if such
      a layout is created manually in the Display Configuration page.
    - Removed the hard dependency on GTK 2 when building nvidia-settings
      from source. nvidia-settings may now be built with support for GTK 2

nvidia-settings (515.86.01-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 515.86.01.
    - Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to find incorrect fan speed
      ranges on some GPUs.  Lower-level layers of the driver protected
      the hardware from programming incorrect fan speeds, so the symptom
      was only incorrect reporting.  Now, reporting in nvidia-settings
      matches what actually gets programmed in hardware.

nvidia-settings (352.79-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 352.79.
  * New upstream release 352.21.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the Display Configuration page of the
      nvidia-settings control panel to automatically generate layouts
      with multiple displays occupying the same position when enabling

      attribute whose value is a display ID on a system with multiple X
      screens.
    - Updated the reporting of in-use video memory in the nvidia-settings
      control panel to use the same accounting methods used in other tools
      such as nvidia-smi. nvidia-settings was not taking some allocations
      into account, e.g. framebuffer memory for the efifb console on UEFI
      systems, causing discrepancies in the values reported by different
      tools.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented GPU fan speed changes from getting reflected
      in the text box on Thermal settings page.
    - Added nvidia-settings commandline support to query the current and
      targeted GPU fan speed.
    - Added a checkbox to nvidia-settings to enable a visual indicator that
      shows when G-SYNC is being used.  This is helpful for displays that
      don't indicate themselves whether they are operating in G-SYNC mode or
      normal mode.
      This setting can also be enabled by running the command line
        nvidia-settings -a ShowGSYNCVisualIndicator=1

      the nvidia-settings control panel.
  * New upstream beta 346.16.
    - Updated nvidia-settings to take advantage of GTK+ 3, when available.
      This is implemented by building the nvidia-settings user interface
      into separate shared libraries (libnvidia-gtk2.so, libnvidia-gtk3.so),
      and loading the correct one at run-time.
    - Added the nvidia-settings option --gtk-library to allow specifying
      the path of the directory containing the user interface library or
      the path and filename of the specific library to use.
    - Added support in nvidia-settings for a GTK+ 3 user interface on x86
      and x86_64.

nvidia-settings (331.38-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 331.38.
    - Updated the behavior of the nvidia-settings PowerMizer Preferred
      Mode drop-down menu, to make the setting apply consistently
      across all GPUs in an SLI group.
    - Added NV-CONTROL attributes to control the brightness of the illuminated
      logos on certain graphics boards.  For example, to turn off the

      be used instead - A display target is one of the display's valid names,
      with an optional GPU or X screen qualifier.
    - Deprecated the following NV-CONTROL attributes:
      NV_CTRL_CONNECTED_DISPLAYS, NV_CTRL_ENABLED_DISPLAYS,
      NV_CTRL_ASSOCIATED_DISPLAYS, NV_CTRL_NOTEBOOK_INTERNAL_LCD,
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTER, NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVES,
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTERABLE, NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVEABLE.
      Also, although NV_CTRL_PROBE_DISPLAYS is still operational, the return
      value has been deprecated and should not be used.
    - Added deprecation warning messages in nvidia-settings when deprecated
      attributes are used.  This also includes display mask usage.
  * Merge changes from 319.72-1.

nvidia-settings (331.13-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 331.13.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented some settings changes made via the
      nvidia-settings command line interface from being reflected in
      the nvidia-settings graphical user interface.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-settings from creating display
      device configuration pages for newly connected DisplayPort 1.2
      Multi Stream Transport downstream devices.
    - Added GPU utilization reporting to the nvidia-settings control panel.
    - Fixed a bug in the nvidia-settings control panel that prevented users
      from configuring stereo, when stereo was not already configured.
    - Added support for reporting the tachometer-measured fan speed on
      capable graphics boards via nvidia-settings and the NV-CONTROL API.
      The preexisting mechanism for reporting fan speed reports the speed
      of the fan as programmed by the driver.
      For example, `nvidia-settings --query=[fan:0]/GPUCurrentFanSpeedRPM`.
    - Fixed a regression that caused GPUs that do not support graphics to not
      appear in nvidia-settings.
    - Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to display incorrect information
      in its display configuration page when all displays on an X screen were
      turned off.
  * Disable patches that don't apply any longer.

  * Merge changes from 319.60-1.

 -- Andreas Beckmann <anbe@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Oct 2013 12:18:27 +0200

nvidia-settings (325.15-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 325.15.
    - Fixed a bug in the nvidia-settings control panel that could cause
      spurious messages about layout inconsistencies to be printed when
      changing the display layout while SLI is enabled.
  * New upstream release 325.08.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the status bar on the "PowerMizer" and
      "X Server XVideo Settings" pages in the nvidia-settings control
      panel from being updated when settings were changed by another
      NV-CONTROL client.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause some UI elements to be duplicated in the
      nvidia-settings control panel following a VT switch on X server
      configurations with multiple NVIDIA X screens.
    - Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that caused GTK+ theme colors to be
      ignored for some UI elements.
    - Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to write hostname-based color
      correction settings to the .nvidia-settings-rc configuration file, even
      when the "Include X Display Names in the Config File" option was unset.
      This could lead to a long delay when starting nvidia-settings, if a
      hostname saved to the configuration file failed to resolve.
    - Fixed a bug that exposed edge overlap controls on the SLI Mosaic
      page of nvidia-settings on edges where overlap was impossible.
    - Fixed a bug that caused some settings in the nvidia-settings control
      panel to be reset when re-probing displays.
    - Added support for configuring SLI Mosaic and Base Mosaic in the "X Server
      Display Configuration" page of nvidia-settings.
    - Updated nvidia-settings to explicitly specify the direction of rotation
      for configuring per-display rotation configuration.
  * Build for armhf, too.
  * Remove patch 01_allow_dark_themes, fixed upstream.
  * Refresh patches 07_fix_hyphenation, 08_fix_format-security.

 -- Andreas Beckmann <anbe@debian.org>  Fri, 05 Jul 2013 13:42:15 +0200

nvidia-settings (319.17-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 319.17.  (Closes: #708570)
    - Updated nvidia-settings to preserve the relative positioning of displays
      when changing from a layout where multiple displays are on the same X
      screen to one where the same displays span multiple X screens.
    - Fixed nvidia-settings to dlopen(3) "libvdpau.so.1", rather than
      "libvdpau.so".
  * New upstream release 319.12.
    - Added an Underscan feature in the nvidia-settings X Server
      Display Configuration page which allows the configuration of an
      underscan border around the ViewPortOut.  This feature was
      formerly known as Overscan Compensation.
    - Updated the nvidia-settings command line interface to accept display
      device names, as well as optional target qualifiers, e.g.
             nvidia-settings -q [DVI-I-0]/RefreshRate
             nvidia-settings -q [GPU-1.DVI_I-1]/RefreshRate
    - Updated the nvidia-settings command line interface to no longer assume
      the "X screen 0" target, when no target is specified in query and assign
      operations.  Instead, all valid targets of the attribute are processed.
    - Added a VDPAU page to the nvidia-settings control panel, to display
      information about the decoding capabilities of VDPAU-capable GPUs.
  * Refresh/update patches 06_fix_typos, 07_fix_hyphenation,
    10_libxnvctrl_so_0.
  * New patch 08_fix_format-security: Fix -Werror=format-security errors.
  * Add Build-Depends: libvdpau-dev.

 -- Andreas Beckmann <debian@abeckmann.de>  Wed, 16 Jan 2013 21:44:29 +0100

nvidia-settings (310.51-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 310.51.
    - Augmented the resolution drop-down in the display configuration
      page of nvidia-settings with "implicit resolutions": for common
      resolutions, if a mode with that resolution is not available for
      a display device, that resolution will be simulated through
      MetaMode ViewPort scaling.
  * New upstream release 310.32.
    - Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented rotation controls in the nvidia-
      settings control panel from working after changing resolutions.

    - Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that made it report the status of ECC
      configuration incorrectly.
    - Updated nvidia-settings to report Dedicated GPU Memory (i.e., the
      memory dedicated exclusively to the GPU) and Total GPU Memory (i.e.,
      Dedicated GPU Memory plus any TurboCache(TM)-accessible system memory)
      separately on the GPU information page.
    - Added reporting of the current utilization of Dedicated GPU Memory to

      within each display device page, instead of a per-X screen color
      correction page.
    - Added the ability to select and move X screens in the "X Server Display
      Configuration" page of nvidia-settings via Ctrl-(Left)Click + Drag

nvidia-settings (302.07-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Added a "CurrentMetaMode" attribute to the nvidia-settings command
      line, to query and set the current MetaMode.
      As an example, these two commands are equivalent:
        xrandr --output DVI-I-2 --mode 1280x1024 --pos 0x0 \
               --output DVI-I-3 --mode 1920x1200 --pos 1280x0
        nvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode=\
                "DVI-I-2: 1280x1024 +0+0, DVI-I-3: 1920x1200 +1280+0"
    - Removed overscan compensation configurability from NV-CONTROL and
      nvidia-settings. This can be configured, with finer granularity,
      through the ViewPortIn and ViewPortOut MetaMode attributes.
      See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen" in the
      README for details.
    - Removed Flat Panel Scaling configurability in nvidia-settings.
      Any desired scaling can be configured through the new "ViewPortIn"
      and "ViewPortOut" MetaMode attributes.
    - Expose the following additional FSAA modes via NV-CONTROL,
      nvidia-settings, and through X visuals and GLXFBConfigs:
        16X multisample FSAA on all GeForce GPUs
        Coverage sample FSAA on G80 and above GeForce GPUs
        32X multisample FSAA on G80 and above Quadro GPUs
        64X multisample FSAA on Fermi and above Quadro GPUs
    - Added a new, higher resolution icon for nvidia-settings.
    - Added a checkbox to nvidia-settings to control the texture clamping
      attribute.  When the box is checked, OpenGL textures are clamped
      according to the OpenGL specification.  When it is unchecked, GL_CLAMP
      is remapped to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE for borderless 2D textures.
    - Removed the "Display" and "X Screen" tabs from the "X Server Display
      Configuration Page" of nvidia-settings, and added a new "Selection"
      dropdown menu for selecting X screens or display devices.  This
      makes it easier to select X screens/Displays that are hidden.
  * Upload to experimental.
  * Drop patches 00_destdir, 03_build_xnvctrl_with_fpic: fixed upstream.
  * Refresh patches 04_link_as-needed, 06_fix_typos, 07_fix_hyphenation,
    10_libxnvctrl_so_0 and adjust for buld system changes.
